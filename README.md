# Robotics Science and Systems (MIT 6.141)

I took this class in Spring 2020. We focused on building and understanding the algorithms behind most robotics in a very hands-on way, so we were split up into teams and each team recieved a robotic racecar to program and compete with. While we didn't build the racecar ourselves, we were responsible for all of its functions, from sensing its enviroment to deciding how to move.  

After every lab, we wrote a report and gave a presentation on our work, both of which are documented through our team website (build through this repo and visible at the link below):
