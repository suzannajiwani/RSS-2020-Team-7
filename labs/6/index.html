Planning a path would mean representing a given map as to allow the vehicle to find a path from its starting position and angle to a specified end state. Our past location estimation system will allow our vehicle to execute the previously calculated path.</span></p><p class="c15 c8"><span class="c23 c28"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c23">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c17">Motivation:</span><span class="c28 c23">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">One of the modern day struggles with autonomous vehicles is calculating a path for the vehicle to traverse and following that path without knowing its ground-truth location. This problem has applications affecting everyday use as autonomous cars are becoming more widely used across the general populous. This brings a high need to better understand the fundamentals of path and motion planning for vehicles operating in real-time as to develop strategies that avoid negative real-world consequences such as a high-crash rate in the case of autonomous cars. This work is also fundamental in mankind&rsquo;s mission to explore deep sea, space, and other planetary bodies as these robots cannot rely on constantly sent commands in real time as to have the robot position itself to collect solar power, send information back to Earth for analyzation, getting itself out of a crater, or avoid paths that would cause the robot to go, &ldquo;missing&rdquo;! As we explore other areas where communication can be hard to establish, it takes longer for commands to be sent successfully, and even more critical that such algorithms be developed well as to allow for more complex missions for the world of robotics.</span></p><p class="c15 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c29 c31"><span class="c17">Technical Approach: (2250 words max)</span><span class="c17 c21">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c17 c21">Operation Path Planning (Suzanna Jiwani)</span></p><p class="c2 c16"><span class="c0">Given a known map, starting position, and end position, the goal of Operation Path Planning is to find the most optimal path from the start to the end that avoids obstacles. In our case, an optimal path is the shortest path, but you can also find other optimal paths for whatever you&rsquo;re trying to minimize. We decided to approach the problem of finding the shortest path between start and end by transforming the problem into a graph problem, where each pose or pixel in the map was a graph node and edges were simply the straight lines connecting the nodes. </span></p><p class="c2 c16"><span class="c0">Once the map was created into an abstract, discrete graph using the pixels given in the map, we were able to generate a path by using a traditional search algorithm, &ldquo;A*&rdquo; where the weight or cost from traveling from one node to a neighboring node would be the distance in meters to get to another node from the connecting node. This algorithm works by starting at the start node and moving outwards, building paths one node at a time. It adds every path to a &lsquo;queue&rsquo; sorted by overall distance where it would be picked later in the algorithm. Once the shortest current path from the start is picked from the queue, you look at the last node in the path and add all of its adjacent nodes to the end of the path, adding the newly created paths to the queue. The algorithm continues to do this until it reaches the goal, and in this way, it can be sure that once it reaches the goal, it has found the shortest path to get there. </span></p><p class="c2 c16"><span class="c1">The most unique aspect about the A* algorithm is that it also takes into account a &lsquo;heuristic&rsquo; in order to guide the paths in the direction of the end node. It does this by weighting paths that end further from the goal more heavily than paths that end closer to the goal, even if each path is the same distance. This can drastically reduce the number of paths that the algorithm considers. It should be noted that since our heuristic is the direct distance from a node to the goal node: the cumulative sum of the distance it took to get to that node plus the heuristic of reaching the goal node is always going to be less than or equal to the total distance needed for a valid path to reach the goal node. This guarantees that a found path from a start node to goal node would be the shortest path possible. More formally, this approach upholds triangle equality and guarantees that the shortest possible path is found as a consequence.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c17 c21">Operation Pure Pursuit (Chrisitan)</span></p><p class="c2 c16"><span class="c0">Operation Pure Pursuit allows our autonomous vehicle to follow a given set of trajectories using our location estimation system (Particle Filter). The autonomous vehicle is aware of it&rsquo;s beginning position and follows a set of trajectories as they are given. Operation Pure Pursuit uses this information to follow along a given trajectory. Until more information is given, the autonomous vehicle &ldquo;drives&rdquo; along this given trajectory until a new trajectory is sent. As it &ldquo;drives&rdquo;, the vehicle updates its estimated location using our location estimation system to be sent and used for more current, updated trajectories.</span></p><p class="c2 c16"><span class="c0">There are three main steps for pure pursuit. The first is to find the nearest point on the trajectory to the robot. The second is to find the point where a circle centered on the robot with a specified &ldquo;lookahead&rdquo; radius intersects with the trajectory ( further along the path than the closest point). Finally, the robot drives towards this &ldquo;lookahead&rdquo; point using Ackermann controls. The bullets below outline a more thorough yet high level explanation of the series of steps that go into pure pursuit:</span></p><ol class="c13 lst-kix_pr30iijxt3de-0 start" start="1"><li class="c2 c18"><span class="c14">Listen to Trajectory Topic:</span><span class="c19 c1">&nbsp;The robot listens to a topic published path planner and creates an array of coordinate points that define a path.</span></li><li class="c2 c18"><span class="c14">Update the Pose of the Robot:</span><span class="c19 c1">&nbsp;Once we receive a trajectory, we then initialize a subscriber which listens to and odometry topic and updates tha pose of the robot. </span></li><li class="c2 c18"><span class="c14">Determine the Closest Point Each Line Segment:</span><span class="c19 c1">&nbsp;By parameterizing an equation for each line segment in the path, we find the closest point on each line segment to the current robot pose. From these distances, we find the closest line segment to the car. Thus, we can ignore any line segment the car has already passed by only using segments with indices larger than the closest segment.</span></li><li class="c2 c18"><span class="c14">Find the Goal Point:</span><span class="c1 c19">&nbsp;We find the intersection of a circle with radius equal to the lookahead distance and the line segments on the path to find a goal point to use as a steering heading.</span></li><li class="c2 c18"><span class="c14">Calculate the Steering Angle: </span><span class="c19 c1">The lookahead goal point is used to determine the angle used in Ackerman steering control, and the car drives towards the goal point until new trajectory segments are used.</span></li></ol><p class="c2 c11"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 381.00px; height: 247.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 381.00px; height: 247.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2 c30"><span class="c26">Figure 1:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The diagram above outlines the high-level concept governing the steering angle for pure pursuit.</span></p><p class="c2 c16"><span class="c1">Integration</span></p><p class="c2 c16"><span class="c1">Localization code determines the starting point of the robot, while a click in the simulation determines a goal position for the robot. Operation Path Planning creates a trajectory for the autonomous vehicle to execute in order to reach this goal position on the map. Operation Path Planning feeds this segmented trajectory into Operation Pure Pursuit and then the control code within Pure Pursuit steers the robot (as outlined above) along the pre-generated path. By integrating the localization, planning, and pursuit components we have already created, we will be able to click anywhere in simulation, generate a path that avoids obstacles, and watch as the robot drives autonomously and uninhibited to that location. </span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c17">Experimental Evaluation:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c17 c21">Path Planning</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the theory versus application measurement, Operation Path Planning would only suggest the shortest possible path from the starting location (red) to the goal location (green) possible with the resolution of the graph. For reference, the path calculated is shown in white whereas the shortest possible path regardless of resolution was outlined in red. Resolution of the map is given an amount of meters represented per pixel. As Operation Path Planning guarantees to find the shortest possible path by upholding the triangle equality (described in &ldquo;Operation Path Planning&rdquo;), the difference of the path found (using a given map) and the shortest path possible is found in units of the given resolution. (Assuming that the resolution was great enough for an estimation of the true shortest traversable path to be considered) </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Consider:</span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 502.50px; height: 510.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 502.50px; height: 510.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This allows the total distance of the path found on the discrete grid to have an upper cap of the square root of 2 times the true distance of the shortest possible path (given the constraint of the vehicle and obstacles). This can be derived by considering the example above where the start node is in red, the goal node in green. The red line is the true shortest path, the green line is the shortest traversable path. The particular example shown above is the worst case estimation. This was also verified through our visual experiment of Path Planning (shown below). We wanted to have more detailed experimental values, but this is as far as we got due to time and hectic schedules.</span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 445.00px; height: 510.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 445.00px; height: 510.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c17 c21">Pure Pursuit</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Due to technical challenges, we were unable to complete this part of our goal within this milestone, but hope to integrate and better understand the whole process of Operation Pure Pursuit to be used in later experiments and products.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c17 c21">Integration</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Due to technical challenges, we were unable to complete this part of our goal within this milestone, but hope to integrate and better understand the whole process of Operation Pure Pursuit to be used in later experiments and products.</span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c17">Conclusion: (Charlie) </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">We were unable to meet our overall goal to develop and integrate the ability for our autonomous vehicle to plan a path to follow given a map and drive along that path by using our location estimation system. We were able to meet our goal of completing Operation Path Planning in creating a system that calculates the shortest possible valid path for our vehicle to traverse from its position to its goal position when given a map and its estimated location on that map. We were also able to successfully implement Operation Path Pursuit that allows our autonomous vehicle to follow a given trajectory and update its new estimated location as it &ldquo;drives&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c5 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10">Lessons Learned:</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c12">Technical Lessons Learned:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9">Ethan Garza:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I was able to better see the importance of how a current, real-world solution can be broken into many smaller parts and how all of those smaller parts can work together to accomplish such a big task! I was even more happy to find out how the basics of Autonomy were derived! Seeing a particular implementation come together was very riveting. I also really enjoy the mindset of working on a problem that still isn&rsquo;t fully, &ldquo;solved&rdquo; to be implemented into today&rsquo;s world to work consistently and is expected in real-time. (Especially for autonomous cars) Seeing the large difficulties associated with tackling this problem adds a much higher level of appreciation that I have for the field of Autonomy and all of it&rsquo;s recent advances. I am also very excited to see the progression of everyday technologies as AI helps to improve this field and hopefully help to advance the understanding of how to approach this problem.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9">Wilson Guo </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Once we were determined to approach the path finding problem as a graph problem, I was really excited to explore the pros and cons of what kind of search algorithm to pursue. Each algorithm had trade-offs such as complexity, intuition, and completeness. After considering the details of the specific problem, I was looking forward to helping choose which one might be the most optimal one for our team. However, another heuristic that came up when deciding an algorithm to pursue was our ability to integrate any algorithm within any certain amount of time. Oddly enough, we used an A* algorithm to come to our conclusion to use A* and was really satisfying to see how effective and abstract an algorithm could be.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9">Suzanna Jiwani</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I enjoyed being able to implement a path-planning algorithm because it made my understanding of how to actually approach the problem more concrete. Through the process of debugging, I also learned a lot about the representation of maps in ROS and how to use them in your algorithm. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9">Charles Magaw</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the reinforcement of the A* algorithm helped me further my understanding of what was covered in the lecture. I found the link to the reblobgames.com article about A* very helpful and the illustrations were great. I enjoyed working on and thinking about the problem of path planning. I can see the advantages and disadvantages of the different search-based planning algorithms. I think A* was a good choice for this lab. I enjoyed working on something that I could see where it would apply to the real world like having a self driving car do path planning.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9">Christian Schillinger</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;One of the important lessons for me in this lab was learning how thorough one needs to be when dissecting technical tasks into manageable pieces. It was very difficult to take on a very large portion of the lab and keep track of parameters and values within the section without first understanding how each part communicated with the others. This made integration very difficult.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c9">CI Lessons Learned:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9">Ethan Garza:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The team had done a great job in working with each other in the beginning of this lab, but as time progressed, it became harder to come together as a group. However, I don&rsquo;t blame anybody because we would generally work well together. I see it as more unfortunate that we just happen to have to work through these sporadic times when everything is so uncertain, remote with an unfathomably many different living situations, and existing when unemployment on the national scale is comparable if not worse than it was during the Great Depression. Although our way of working together as a team is not perfect and becomes farther from it as our attention is focused towards other classes, work, and other life events, I find comfort considering that our teamwork could be a lot worse. I am fortunate to be a part of a hard-working, caring team. My hope is that we learn from these hard times to work better together as a team and serve as an example for later teams that we&rsquo;ll be a part of.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9">Wilson Guo </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">This lab helped me to learn a new-found sense of appreciation for teamwork. During these past two weeks, I&rsquo;ve had to be in constant communication with S^3 and deal with many problems associated with the current ongoing pandemic. On top of this, I also had a sense of duty to classwork and especially team projects. These times have been very difficult for me, but I am also grateful to see how effective communication could be. Even though I wasn&rsquo;t able to make most of the meetings, I was able to contribute late at night for whatever the team needed, and they were very kind in helping me when I wasn&rsquo;t able to be present. As a consequence, I&rsquo;ve learned the benefits of communication and healthy team dynamics.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9">Suzanna Jiwani</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">In general, we didn&rsquo;t work together in pairs or small groups as much this lab as we did for the last one, and that meant that we couldn&rsquo;t help each other as well when someone ran into problems. This week, it seemed that finding time for everyone to get together and work on code was particularly difficult so that led to team members working on tasks individually, making integration difficult. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9">Charles Magaw</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I continue to learn more about communication every week that this stay at home order lasts. I feel like recently I have seen people grow tired of the situation. I share this feeling as it is not a fun way to work or live. However communication can help in both of these regards. For working, communication is as important as ever and checking in on others can help keep the group on track and feel like a team where the members care about each other. Also checking in with friends is important in this time, at least for me communication helps me feel less bored and lonely. I think that we will be able to learn from this experience and become better team members in future work groups.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9">Christian Schillinger</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this lab in particular, our team did not communicate very thoroughly at the start of the lab, which resulted in considerable troubles in the long run. To start, it felt like each member did not really understand much about parts outside the part they were working on. When we came together to integrate the parts of the lab, I found it difficult to understand path planning and found it equally difficult to explain our pure pursuit code. I also learned a lesson about how to effectively ask for help on something I was struggling with. In the future I hope to better define what I am struggling with and then ask teammates directly, as opposed to simply stating that I would eventually need help testing my section.</span></p><p class="c15 c29"><span>&nbsp;</span></p></body></html>
