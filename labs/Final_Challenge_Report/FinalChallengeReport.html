class="c13">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c34">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c28">Goals: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c9">Our main goal is to apply our previous work to the final challenge such that the racecar smoothly follows an assigned trajectory without collision. Using previous labs, the race car will be able to determine its current state and environment, determine a path, pursue that path while avoiding obstacles. With these goals in mind, we hoped to achieve a racetime of less than sixty seconds with minimal collisions. </span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c13">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c5">Motivation:</span><span class="c32 c13 c37">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">As with any autonomous machine, the main purpose is to have the machine function optimally with minimal human interaction. Just as it is imperative for a human to safely reach a destination in a speeding vehicle, any self-driving car must faithfully follow a determined &ldquo;best&rdquo; trajectory while prioritizing the safety of the passengers. One of the main arguments against self-driving cars is that they are unreliable compared to a human. If we can create a car that adheres to safety guidelines while performing better than a human, we can advance the ideals of autonomy towards more than just self-driving vehicles. With respect to the class, additional motivation comes from previous labs - throughout the semester we&rsquo;ve been working to create an operational self-driving car. </span></p><p class="c23"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 362.50px; height: 297.44px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 362.50px; height: 297.44px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c5">Technical Approach: (2250 words max)</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Integration (Suzanna)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">In order to integrate all of the components, whether from old labs or code made specifically for the final challenge, the first important step was to go in and change all the parameters so that they would match the TESSE simulator interface. For example, the original localization assumed a specific number of LiDAR scans so that it could parse it properly, but there are many more scans from the LiDAR in the TESSE simulator, so we had to go in and modify that laser scan parsing. More generally, for every piece of code we used, we had to make sure that they were subscribing and publishing to topics that matched the TESSE simulator. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c9">Next, we needed to create launch files for both races. Both launch files were structured the same, they just used different trajectories. We started by launching the TESSE simulator interface so that we could run the final challenge simulator. Next, we launched our localize_tesse localization file with all of the matching parameters so that our car could know where it was on the map as it moved (since we weren&rsquo;t given ground truth odometry). Then, we loaded our trajectory, depending on which trajectory we were trying to follow. For the final race, we chose to follow the short path, and for the fast obstacle avoidance challenge, we simply had a straight line through the required section of the map. In the fast obstacle launch file, we also loaded the obstacles using the launch file provided to us. Once we had a trajectory to follow, we launched our pure pursuit so that it would follow the trajectory. Finally, we also choose to launch our safety controller in both final challenges so that we could minimize collisions. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Trajectory Planning (Suzanna)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">In order to plan the trajectories we were going to follow, we started by visualizing the output of our path planning code from Lab 6. While this does yield the shortest path, it often cut corners very close and thus proved infeasible for our path planning code to follow. In addition, it was made of hundreds of points, making it difficult for us to be able to come in and modify the path. Instead, we decided to drive the car around the map manually and mark down key points along the trajectory, with 4-7 points around a corner so that we could smoothly turn. Then, we made a python script that could take a list of those points and turn it into a form usable by the Trajectory class that we used in Lab 6. We also found a way to plot and modify the points in MatLab so that we could round out the corners that the car was struggling to follow. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Trajectory Following (Christian)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">The trajectory following in our final project is based heavily on our pure pursuit algorithm from Lab 6. As such, the pure pursuit algorithm we made uses the following high level structure:</span></p><ul class="c22 lst-kix_8ulxd3s80h60-0 start"><li class="c10 c20"><span class="c14 c31">Update the Pose of the Robot:</span><span class="c32 c9 c31">&nbsp;Once we receive a trajectory, we then initialize a subscriber which listens to an odometry topic and updates the pose of the robot.</span></li><li class="c16 c10"><span class="c14 c31">Determine the Closest Point Each Line Segment:</span><span class="c32 c9 c31">&nbsp;By parameterizing an equation for each line segment in the path, we find the closest point on each line segment to the current robot pose. From these distances, we find the closest line segment to the car. </span></li><li class="c16 c10"><span class="c14 c31">Find the Goal Point:</span><span class="c9 c31 c32">&nbsp;We find the intersection of a circle with radius equal to the lookahead distance and the line segments on the path to find a goal point to use as a steering heading. To prevent the robot from following the wrong path at intersections, we implemented a &ldquo;segment lookahead&rdquo; parameter, an integer that specifies how many segments the robot should look at in front or behind the closest segment.</span></li><li class="c10 c16"><span class="c14 c31">Calculate the Steering Angle: </span><span class="c32 c9 c31">The lookahead goal point is used to determine the angle used in Ackerman steering control, and the car drives towards the goal point until new trajectory segments are used. A proportional gain is applied to this steering angle to better the performance while turning corners on the trajectory. </span></li></ul><p class="c7"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 381.00px; height: 247.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 381.00px; height: 247.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c10 c26"><span class="c14">Figure 2:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The diagram above outlines the high-level concept governing the steering angle for pure pursuit.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c9">An important addition to our pure pursuit algorithm for the final race is the inclusion of variable speed. Our controller determines the distance from the pose of the car to the start and the end of the closest segment. If these distances are above certain thresholds, it means that the car is in a long straightaway, and can afford to accelerate. The deceleration threshold is quite large, as it is more important to take a curve without crashing than it is to take the curve quickly. The acceleration threshold is smaller, but still large enough to ensure the car has corrected its orientation and is pointed along the trajectory before it speeds up.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Safety Avoidance Mechanism (S.A.M.) (Ethan)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">The first few implementations of Integration and Trajectory planning had worked well initially, but would occasionally crash into obstacles or become a bit off course. In running and testing the first stages of integration and trajectory planning, it became evident that our approach needed some variable fine tuning or an additional component. Due to a lack of hardware equipment to run the simulations on, fine tuning the variables for our trajectory was done and an additional add-on was worked on in parallel after viewing inconsistent results. This addition became, &ldquo;Smart Avoidance&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Previously, Operation Pure Pursuit from Lab6 was completed and had worked well. However, our out-sourced localization code in combination with Pure Pursuit led to a build up of errors that caused our autonomous vehicles that would cause our vehicle to crash into obstacles near our previously tuned path of trajectories. This was to be expected as the aforementioned worked on only attempting to follow the path without taking into consideration any of its surroundings, leading for the need of a complimentary piece that only considered the vehicles nearby surroundings for real-time obstacle avoidance.</span></p><p class="c7"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 352.00px; height: 341.54px;"><img alt="" src="images/image9.png" style="width: 352.00px; height: 341.54px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Abstractly, if the vehicle were to experience a future collision, it would cause an emergency turn towards a relative left or right direction. In deciding whether to turn left or right, the vehicle considers a quick estimation of which direction appears to be more promising. It does this by comparing the closest set of points near itself in either direction and chooses the one with more room to turn towards. Due to limited testing capacity, there was a distance forward from the car between a set of angles between, &ldquo;Theta 1&rdquo; and &ldquo;Theta 2&rdquo; respectively. These values were fine tuned after observing its function through simulation. Although a more complex version would have been pursued where these angles were variable to the car&rsquo;s speed, and only the distance directly in front of the car would be considered (of where the car would be). &nbsp;The car&rsquo;s max turning speed of 30 degrees would have also been considered for non-collision avoidance when considering the vehicle&rsquo;s possible turning radius. (Rather than all of this being estimated through observation rather than calculation)</span></p><p class="c7 c19"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 329.00px; height: 357.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image8.png" style="width: 329.00px; height: 357.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c10 c19"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">Experimental Evaluation: </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Integration (Suzanna)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c9">To evaluate integration, we simply ran the launch files locally and observed the RVIZ and TESSE simulator to make sure everything was running as we expected.

The middle trajectory is our local solution, which was built by dragging segment points to better locations. The rightmost trajectory is our final trajectory, which was made by modifying our local solution such that the sharper corners account for differences in computation speed between our local machines and the test server.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Our initial trajectory had very round corners, which resulted in the car turning too early cutting corners, and ultimately not finishing the race. Because our car uses a high lookahead distance, curving the corners had the effect of shifting the lookahead point in the direction of turning before it should be shifted. This problem was remedied by making the majority of corners quite sharp (with the notable exception of the first corner, which was left rounded to account for the high speed of the car at the start of the turn). As shown in Figure 5, our local solution was quite simple, used sharp corners, and performed well. Running on our local machines without a safety controller, a car following this trajectory completed the course in 59 seconds and had two minor collisions (see Trajectory Following). Finally, our competition trajectory is a version of our local solution in which the corners are sharper (to account for some unknown difference between our local system and the competition test system). Running on the competition system with the addition of a safety controller, a car following this trajectory completed the course in 58.95 seconds and had one light and one brush collision (see Safety Avoidance Mechanism). At the end of the project, we determined that a well made trajectory is necessary, but time should be spent optimizing a safety controller rather than fine tuning the locations of each segment endpoint in the trajectory. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Trajectory Following (Christian)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">The video below shows the result of our trajectory following algorithm.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c9 c24"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/cKBaSir9FWU&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1589358010822000">https://youtu.be/cKBaSir9FWU</a></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c9">The car completed the course in just under one minute and had two small collisions, both of which occurred because of small objects near the edge of the path, and as such are not a result of poorly performing trajectory following (they are instead a result of a combination of a lack of a safety controller and an imperfect trajectory). The acceleration out of corners and deceleration into corners is especially apparent on the two long sections of track, but is in effect on all trajectory segments longer than 55 meters. The trajectory follower could be further improved in the future by increasing the straightaway speed (while also adjusting the deceleration distance) or optimizing the lookahead distance in corners.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Safety Avoidance Mechanism (S.A.M.)

We were able to meet our goals for lap time and collisions in the final race with a time of 58.95 seconds and only two minor collisions. Additionally we used S.A.M. to complete the obstacle avoidance course with a time of 13.22 seconds and two collisions. We were able to achieve this performance by applying our previous work to the final challenge. The end result was a car in simulation that was able to use pure pursuit and obstacle avoidance to complete a race around a course in an urban environment. Outside of RSS, this software could be implemented onto an autonomous car with an onboard lidar that would then be able to complete a track using a planned trajectory.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c5 c28">Lessons Learned:</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c14 c25">Technical Lessons Learned:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Ethan Garza:</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">I learned and was reminded of the nice tools that platforms such as roscore tend to make available to the user. While working on the final challenge, it was easy to feel stuck and isolated. However, I was really grateful to be reminded about how to derive correct publishing topics as it added a large amount of flexibility to our project. It also allowed for much faster rates of debugging and helped me to help contribute to many aspects of our project in terms of debugging. Improving my understanding of platforms such as rospy has helped me greatly in becoming a much better engineer by understanding my teammate&rsquo;s code and intentions and improving it or debugging it. Even though I will most likely be graduating with a bachelors of science degree, I feel that I might now have enough qualifications to call myself an engineer.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Wilson Guo </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c9">During this final RSS challenge that combined various topics in the class, we learned how each piece of the lab fit together. In lab five, we estimated the location of the car. In lab six, we planned for the car to adhere to a particular trajectory we found. In the final challenge, we combined labs five and six with our safety stopper from our first team lab to create a &ldquo;bare bones&rdquo; autonomous vehicle. Additionally, of all the labs, this lab really emphasized the need for a solid understanding of ROS. Since the final challenge was built on our virtual machine, but tested on our local laptops, we needed a way to sync the two together. This proved to be a challenge for most of our machines, especially since running some tests on different machines lead to different results. As a result, we had to research other ROS commands such as ros.sleep() and ros.rate() to complete a working product. Overall, this final challenge helped strengthen my understanding of how various topics relate and challenged me to learn more about ROS.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Suzanna Jiwani</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">I learned how to structure and form launch files as well as how to modify and integrate parameters and node names for smooth integration. Before, a lot of this work was done for us in the labs and we simply had to launch an already-made launch file, but this time the launch file that would be launched on race day was empty, so we had to go in and make sure that everything worked well. I also learned a lot about pure pursuit through the process of debugging and refining it. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Charles Magaw</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c9">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned about how git submodules are used. While I do not know everything about them I can use them and I understand them. Also I learned more about ROS and TESSE while setting up the simulator on my virtual machine. I was able to get it set up but when it came to racing around in the simulation, on my computer the car acted differently than on another team member&rsquo;s. This happened again on race day when our code was run on the server there were collisions that we did not see on our local machines. This taught me that it is important to use the system that you will end up using when testing if possible.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Christian Schillinger</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c9">At the start of the final project, I had a few troubles getting my simulator to run properly, and ran into issues building the respective parts of the labs, which resulted in difficulties when trying to run launch files. The steps I took to fix my system built up my knowledge of ROS and the TESSE system so much that by the end of the project, I had a far more robust understanding of the architecture of our system than I did while working on each individual part. My work on our team&rsquo;s pure pursuit algorithm was a balance between pulling parts of our old code that worked well and combining them with new code specific to the new application. This was difficult at first, but as I continued to pour hours into the script, I managed to find a system and rhythm that I am excited to take to my next project. </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c4">CI Lessons Learned:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Ethan Garza:</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c9">This final challenge has been extremely insightful for me as I work with other people, teams, and projects. I had seen the dynamics of teams as they progress with time, deadlines, stress, and a lack of resources. To begin with, we had done our best to get this final challenge&rsquo;s simulator on all of our computers. However, it became evident very quickly that we really only had one person who could run it. Other teammates had difficulties in letting them attempt to run it, others were able to set up the programs correctly, but didn&rsquo;t have enough computing power to be of any use. As we got closer to the final challenge, there was so much stress involved that clear reasoning and communication became clouded. When trying to help, it could be very difficult as some people might be tuned out and could lead to feeling helpless when wanting to help and spending time to help, but seemingly not able to. Because of this, I took the route of working and refining a complimentary feature. That way my efforts may have some contribution rather than being someone who may be seen as a distraction. From there, I made sure to reach out to all teammates who seemed to want to contribute more but may not have known where to start. From there, I refined their code (since they could not do compile tests, etc) checked the code conceptually, and became a voice for it to be tested, improved, and implemented within our final submission. Notably, this was even difficult from my end as I could not do many basic tests myself (due to not having a strong enough computer to run the simulator) and had to verify a lot of the code before promoting it (As taking the time to test new code could take some convincing). To help with this process, I reached out to TAs and made use of OH to get the code ready to run and up to par before promoting it. Thankfully, the ROS staff was very friendly and very understanding. All together, it was a very insightful experience as I pursue my own startup, and see how team dynamics can play out. I learned how to prevent and work with such conflicts along with organizing and delegate a series of tasks to have the best results. As a side note, S.A.M. was a tribute to one of my past dogs that I had while growing up, Sam. As most things are inspired by nature, many researchers are in awe of how nature&rsquo;s solution to problems (in this case obstacle avoidance) could be so simple, elegant, and effective yet be extremely difficult to recreate to any degree. Sam was clumsy in comparison to most dogs, but was always successful when avoiding my mother&rsquo;s grasp to get a shower. Much to his dismay, it was a battle that he never won, but one that he was able to drag out. Our implementation of our S.A.M. was inspired by observing his maneuvers when avoiding my mother&rsquo;s attempts to bathe him from when I was a child. It was when attempting to create an implementation for S.A.M. that these memories had resurfaced. </span><span class="c24 c9"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1AgZi84qdRAaw5euV23Yk_TIA6eB88maCdwQGjus1GKk/edit?usp%3Dsharing&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1589358010828000">Click here</a></span><span class="c9">&nbsp;for a picture of Sam.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Wilson Guo </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c14 c25">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">The dominating CI lesson during this challenge was contemplating multiple ideas. Since the simulation provided a foreign testing environment we needed to think outside the box, especially since some of the features could not be detected by the racecar(e.g. the pole). This was a great exercise in creating multiple scenarios before the testing phase. Additionally, we learned how helpful it was to get the perspective of multiple TAs and not just the ones assigned to us. I noticed that the entire team was most productive after our conversation with Professor Carlone. After revealing everyone&rsquo;s struggles both inside the class and outside the class, we were better able to understand each other and plan in advance. Although counterintuitive, it might not be best to jump straight into working on tasks, but rather talk through what&rsquo;s on people&rsquo;s minds. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Suzanna Jiwani</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c9">I&rsquo;ve found that effectively communicating and planning in advance are much harder with remote teamwork, since people can be preoccupied with other assignments and it can be difficult to express that to the team. This leads to issues where some people can&rsquo;t really contribute much because they&rsquo;re occupied with other things but can&rsquo;t find a time to work with the team on code. Additionally, it is more difficult to get the technical help we need, even while going to office hours regularly. However, as a team, we&rsquo;re managing these problems well since we all are willing to both listen to each other and try to split up work in a way that makes sense given each person&rsquo;s individual needs, but the balance of work may sometimes be unfair. All in all, we work well together as a team, ensuring everyone feels a part of the team, though we still find ourselves struggling with remote work.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Charles Magaw</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c9">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout this course and lab work I have learned a lot about myself and team dynamics. Firstly I work much better when I can talk to other team members about the problem or what we are doing. I also found that communication was possibly the most important for teamwork. For labs where our group communicated more I feel like we finished with a better end product for the most part. I know it was a crazy time and it was not always easy to communicate and work together but now I will know in the future to make sure to communicate well for the entirety of group work.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Christian Schillinger</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c9">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were two major CI lessons for me throughout the duration of this project. The first is how helpful it is to thoroughly explain any code I have written on my own. As the team member to take the lead on pure pursuit in the previous lab, I also immediately started working on the trajectory follower for the final project. Coming back to the group and explaining every phrase in my code not only helped my team members understand what our robot was doing and how they could assist in development, but it also showed me where the holes in my understanding were and ultimately led to a much more robust system overall. In the future, I plan to try to focus on this technique as a main avenue of problem solving, as it emphasizes what the team does not know, rather than reinforcing what the team does know. I enjoyed RSS as a whole and can honestly say that the CI skills I developed in my struggle to write working code are perhaps more valuable than the technical skills I was so focused on creating.</span></p><p class="c18 c30"><span>&nbsp;</span></p></body></html>
